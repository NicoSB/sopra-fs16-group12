# About

This repository stores the source code generated during our Software Praktikum in FS16 at the University of Zurich. The final product was a mobile implementation of the 2015's game of the year, [Colt Express](http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/de/colt-express).

## Additional Info

The client was programmed for the Android platform. The backend provides a basic REST interface which was implemented using Spring Boot.
